Hi, I'm Delia. I graduated as a film director, trained to capture stories that touch hearts.

Today, I'm in the business of containers and tradingâ€”a universe that demands order, precision, and world vision. 

The two fields may seem like worlds apart on the surface, but to me they are as close as two linked fingers. 

Directing has been my education in how to weave perspectives, dance through intricacy, and infuse concepts with life. 

Trading honed my skill in adapting quickly, handling multiple collaborations, and performing under pressure. 

Together, they mold me into an individual who not only produces, but also implements with precision and intention.
